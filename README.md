# English-Profiency-Index

This repository is for EPI data science project requiring me to answer the following questions.

Problem statement:
1.	How many people in the world speak ‘proficient’ English (meaning suitable for business or academic work)?
2.	How has that evolved over the past 100 years?
3.	How is it likely to evolve over the next 100 years?



Solution:

I have attached the report in the repository and below is the link to tableau vizualization.
